# Project Report: All-in-One System for Factory Production Floors

## Introduction

In 2022, our company undertook the challenge of addressing a recurring issue faced by our clients in factory production environments. Many clients were hesitant to utilize traditional computers in these settings due to concerns about durability, ease of use, or practicality. To overcome these challenges, I proposed developing an All-in-One system tailored specifically for production floor requirements. This innovative project not only resolved the clients’ concerns but also emerged as one of the most successful projects of our company since its inception.

## Project Overview

The All-in-One system is a compact, durable, and integrated hardware-software solution designed for demanding industrial environments. Key features include a custom-built hardware design, an intuitive client-side application, and a robust service-based software architecture for centralized control.

## My Contributions

### Concept and Design Proposal

- Identified the need for a specialized system and proposed the development of the All-in-One device.
- Collaborated with the hardware team, providing detailed requirements to ensure the system met client needs.

### Software Development

- **Client Application**: Initially developed in Java, later refactored and optimized in C# to enhance performance and maintainability. Runs directly on the All-in-One device.
- **Service-Based Software**: Designed and implemented a service-based architecture to enable centralized monitoring and control of multiple devices in the production environment.
- **Windows Client**: Developed a complementary Windows-based client application in C# to allow administrators to interact seamlessly with the system. This software also supports detailed report generation.
- **Database Management**: Configured and integrated Microsoft SQL Server for efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.

### Hardware Collaboration

- Worked closely with the hardware team to select durable components suitable for factory environments.
- Chose a metal body for the device to withstand harsh conditions and ensure long-term reliability.
- Recommended and integrated a Raspberry Pi board for the main processing unit, balancing performance and cost-effectiveness.

## Key Functionalities

- **Integration with Scales**: Connects to industrial scales, allowing users to input production data seamlessly and accurately.
- **Durable Hardware Design**: Ensures operation in harsh industrial environments.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Compatibility between the All-in-One system and Windows-based administrative tools.
- **Scalability**: Centralized control software enables management of multiple units across the production floor.
- **Report Generation**: Managers can create and view detailed production and system usage reports.
- **Secure Database**: Utilizes Microsoft SQL Server to handle critical data with reliability and security.

## Project Success

This project has been a standout success for our company, receiving positive feedback from clients for its functionality, durability, and user-friendliness. Features such as scale integration for production input and comprehensive reporting tools for managers have been particularly well-received. Since its deployment, it has significantly streamlined operations in production environments and demonstrated measurable improvements in efficiency.

## Attached Materials

- Photographs of the All-in-One system in use are included as attachments.
- **Note**: Source code for the software components is not shared due to the commercial nature of this project.

## Conclusion

The All-in-One system has been a milestone project for our company, showcasing our ability to deliver custom hardware-software solutions. This project highlights my contributions as a key driver of innovation, development, and success, ensuring we continue to meet and exceed client expectations in industrial technology.
